      <h2><b>Difference between margins, paddings and borders</b></h2>
      <p>
        <i
          >The main difference between padding and margin is that padding
          controls how much breathing room exists within a box, <br>while margin
          controls how much breathing room or whitespace exists outside of a
          box.<br />Padding can be set to zero pixels and above. It can change
          its own element's size and impact how much of a fill color or
          background image is visible within a box.<br />Border is the strip
          that goes around your div/element of the content. Padding is the space
          between the content and the border. Margin is the space outside the
          border.
